# NFTOnIPDS

The objective of this dApp is to build an NFT collection while the images and the metadata are stored on IPFS.
Furthermore, a front-end is also created to allow users to connect to the dApp and mint an NFT.

This code is not to be used for production purposes.
It is a project built only for learnin purposes, mostly focusing on using IPFS in a simple case.

You can access the dApp [here](https://nft-on-ipfs-rho.vercel.app/).
